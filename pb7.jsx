Problem 31: Debounce Function  [Medium]
Description: Write a debounce(fn, delay) function that delays invoking fn until after delay milliseconds have elapsed since the last time it was called.
Example:
const debouncedSearch = debounce(search, 300);// Fires only once after user stops typing for 300ms
Hint: Use clearTimeout and setTimeout.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Problem 32: Throttle Function  [Medium]
Description: Write a throttle(fn, limit) function that ensures fn is called at most once every limit milliseconds.
Example:
const throttledScroll = throttle(onScroll, 200);// Fires at most once every 200ms during scroll
Hint: Track the last call time with Date.now().

 
 
 
 
 
 
Problem 33: Deep Clone an Object  [Medium]
Description: Write a function deepClone(obj) that returns a deep copy of a plain object without using JSON.parse/JSON.stringify.
Example:
const a = {x: {y: 1}};const b = deepClone(a);b.x.y = 99;// a.x.y is still 1
Hint: Use recursion and check for object/array types.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Problem 34: Event Emitter  [Medium]
Description: Build a simple EventEmitter class with on(event, listener), emit(event, ...args), and off(event, listener) methods.
Example:
const emitter = new EventEmitter();emitter.on('greet', name => console.log('Hello ' + name));emitter.emit('greet', 'Sara'); // Hello Sara
Hint: Store listeners in an object where keys are event names and values are arrays of functions.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Problem 35: Implement Array.prototype.map from Scratch  [Medium]
Description: Write a function myMap(arr, callback) that replicates the behavior of Array.prototype.map without using the built-in map().
Example:
myMap([1,2,3], x => x * 2);// Output: [2, 4, 6]
Hint: Loop through the array, apply the callback to each element, push results to a new array.
